‚úÖ STEP 1: UNBLOCK THE APP (GATEKEEPER FIX)

1. Open the Terminal app (press ‚åò Command + Space, then type: Terminal)

2. Copy and paste this command into Terminal:

xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ~/Downloads/gui_version/Start_Smart_Temp.command

‚ö†Ô∏è If you moved the folder to Documents or another location, change the path above to match.  
For example, if it‚Äôs in Documents change above line from Downloads to Documents.

‚úÖ STEP 2: OPEN THE TOOL

After running the command, just **double-click the file**:

`Start_Smart_Temp.command`

That‚Äôs it. The tool will open and install anything it needs automatically.

üí° You‚Äôll need Python 3.10 or higher installed.

‚ö†Ô∏è What This Command Does

The command above **only unlocks this one file** so macOS will allow it to run.  
It doesn‚Äôt disable any security settings and nothing stays open or running in the background.
