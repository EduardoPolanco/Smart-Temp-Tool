Bash Launcher Script (macOS)
=============================

This tool includes a `.command` file to make the GUI launchable with a simple double-click on macOS:

ðŸŸ¢ Script: Start_Smart_Temp.command  
ðŸ”§ Action: Runs `python3 gui_main.py`

Why this is needed:
--------------------
By default, macOS does not let Python scripts run with a double-click. To fix this:

1. The script was made executable:
   chmod +x Start_Smart_Temp.command

2. The quarantine flag was removed to bypass security popups:
   xattr -d com.apple.quarantine Start_Smart_Temp.command

Now users can double-click `Start_Smart_Temp.command` to launch the GUI without using Terminal.

Note:
-----
This is only needed for macOS.  
Windows users can simply double-click `gui_main.py` (assuming Python is installed).
