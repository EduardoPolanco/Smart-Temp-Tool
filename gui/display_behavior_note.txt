TEMPERATURE & BATTERY DISPLAY NOTE:

This Smart Temp Tool GUI displays a simulated temperature gauge and a static battery level indicator for visual feedback.

• The temperature bar simulates heating/cooling progress from the initial to the desired temperature. This is purely visual based on temperature difference and does not reflect real-time sensor data.

• The battery level bar reflects the value provided in the input data file. It is not dynamically reduced during simulation. Power usage is instead shown as a calculated percentage and used for recommendations.

This behavior aligns with the requirements stated in the project spec:
- Visual dashboard-style display
- Simulated temperature indicator
- Battery status indicator (not live drain)

No real hardware integration is required or expected.

Optional Input Tips:

• Drink Type — Type a name like tea, iced coffee, water. This field filters results by liquid name (case-insensitive).
• Max Time (min) — Enter a number like 5 or 10.5 to filter by heating/cooling duration. Leave it blank to include all.

❗ Don’t worry — if the format is wrong, the app will show a popup with an example to help you fix it.
